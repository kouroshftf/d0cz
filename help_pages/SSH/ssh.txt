ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""

# -C ""   means no comment
# -N ""   means no password, otherwise it will ask


# As of 2024 rsa 4096 is pretty good to use IMO. sha1 is broken, and an old scheme w/
# rsa and sha1 existed in openssh 7.2 or earlier, thats been superceded by sha256 and
# 512 and new SSH will just use it. however connecting to SSH 8 from 6 may not work.
